> This morning, at approximately 4:00 AM PT, we became aware of an exploit on the Opyn ETH Put contracts via a user report in our Discord chat. This exploit allowed an attacker to “double exercise” oTokens and steal the collateral posted by certain sellers of these puts. At the time of this post, we’ve found **371,260 USDC** that has been stolen from these contracts, but this amount may change as our investigation continues. 439,170 USDC from outstanding vaults was successfully recovered by a white hat hack that the Opyn team conducted on the Convexity Protocol to mitigate further loss. (Update: Working with samczsun we were able to whitehack an additional 132,995 USDC.)
