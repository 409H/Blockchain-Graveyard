Livecoin landing website was overwritten with the following message (with a RU translation underneath)

> ATTENTION!!!
>
>
> Dear clients, we ask you to stop using our service in all meanings: don't deposit funds, don't trade, don't use API. 
> We are under a carefully planned attack, which has been prepared, as we assume, over the last few months. We lost 
> control of all of our servers, backend and nodes. Thus, we were not able to stop our service in time. Our news channels 
> were compromised as well. At the moment, we partially control frontend, and so we're able to place this announcement. We're 
> fighting hard to get back our servers, nodes and funds, we're working 24/7. News and next update will come up in the next 
> few days. We're working in contact with local police authorities. We really do our best to overcome this issue.
