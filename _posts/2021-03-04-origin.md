About $7M lost. 
> The attack was a reentrancy bug in our contract. Unfortunately, our contract was safe from reentrancy bugs unless one of our supported stablecoins was attacking us.
> The attacker exploited a missing validation check in mint multiple (when minting OUSD with multiple stablecoins) to pass in a fake “stablecoin” under their control. This “stablecoin” was then called “transferFrom” on by the vault, allowing the hacker to exploit the contract with a reentrancy attack in the middle of the mint.
> The attacker was able to create a rebase event inside the second mint after funds had moved to OUSD from the first large mint, but before the supply of OUSD increased. This created a massive rebase for everyone in the contract, including the attacker. The attacker then also received their first large OUSD mint, giving them in total more OUSD than the contract had assets.
> The attacker withdrew most of the stablecoins from OUSD.
They were then able to take extra OUSD after withdrawing and sell it on Uniswap and Sushiswap for USDT in subsequent transactions.
