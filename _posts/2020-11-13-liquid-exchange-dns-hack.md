On the 13th of November 2020, a domain name hosting provider that manages one of our core 
domain names incorrectly transferred control of the account and domain to a malicious actor. 
This gave the actor the ability to change DNS records and in turn, take control of a number of 
internal email accounts. In due course, the malicious actor was able to partially compromise 
our infrastructure, and gain access to document storage.

We believe the malicious actor was able to obtain personal information from our user database.  
This may include data such as your email, name, address and encrypted password.
