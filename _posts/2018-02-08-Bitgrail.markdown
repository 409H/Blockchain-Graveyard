This is one of the harder breaches to decipher, as there are a lot of conspiracy articles and accusations by all parties involved. Underlying the Bitgrail breach seems to be some kind of application error of some sort, as opposed to a fully hijacked wallet, but this doesn't have a lot of certainty involved. The Nano core team (the currency involved) announced [suspicion of the exchange](https://medium.com/@nanocurrency/official-statement-regrading-bitgrail-insolvency-ed4422bf274b) and their claims.

>We now have sufficient reason to believe that Firano has been misleading the Nano Core Team and the community regarding the solvency of the BitGrail exchange for a significant period of time.

However, the [Bitgrail accusations](http://archive.is/huzBF) have pointed towards a thief, and blockchain viewing software developed by Nano.

>BitGrail Srl once again confirms that it was the victim of a theft, which took advantage of malfunctions of the software made available by the NANO team (rai_node and official block explorer) and, therefore, also for these reasons and according to the law, is not absolutely responsible, for any reason, of the incident.
