KICKICO posted details of a breach regarding their smart contract. An attacker managed to obtain the
private key to the smart contract and used that to transfer $7.7M in funds into their posession.

The attackers circumvented security checks by deleting and then recreating coins, avoiding a large
set of suspicious transfers.

Note: Charting as "unknown" until the method used to obtain the private key are disclosed
