This is Parity's second appearance in the graveyard.

A vulnerability in the Parity Wallet library contract of the standard multi-sig contract has been found.

>  Following the fix for the original multi-sig vulnerability that had been exploited on 19th of July (function visibility), a new version of the Parity Wallet library contract was deployed on 20th of July. Unfortunately, that code contained another vulnerability which was undiscovered at the time - it was possible to turn the Parity Wallet library contract into a regular multi-sig wallet and become an owner of it by calling the initWallet function.

> "It is our current understanding that this vulnerability was triggered accidentally on 6th Nov 2017 02:33:47 PM +UTC and subsequently a user deleted the library-turned-into-wallet, wiping out the library code which in turn rendered all multi-sig contracts unusable and funds frozen since their logic (any state-modifying function) was inside the library."
