> An incident occurred on Balancer today which allowed an attacker to drain funds from 2 pools that contained tokens with transfer fees (sometimes referred to as deflationary tokens). STA and STONK were the tokens in each pool. Note: this only affects pools where a token has these transfer fees.

> “We were not aware this specific type of attack was possible.”
