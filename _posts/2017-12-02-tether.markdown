Tether lost $31 million in "tokens". Tether tokens allow you to "store, send and receive digital tokens pegged to dollars, euros, and yen person-to-person, globally". Based on wording in Tether blog posts, a "treasury wallet" was drained by an external attacker. This infers that some sort of key material, or signature generating process was misused, so I estimate this ultimately required the breach of a high risk server. This estimation is low confidence and could change with new information, for instance, if the treasury wallet was cold, or held on a compromised endpoint by an employee. Remote access requires some aspect of wallet "warmth" which makes me believe it was online on a server. The Tether team claims high confidence in identifying their root cause so this is not an "unknown" root cause.

> On Sunday, November 19th, $30,950,010.00 in Tether tokens were stolen from our treasury wallet through malicious action by an external attacker. While we are in the process of co-ordinating and co-operating with law enforcement on this matter, we are satisfied that we have found the cause of the breach of Tetherâ€™s systems. We are taking measures to recover the Tethers and are migrating the platform to a new infrastructure. More information about our initial response to this breach is [here](https://tether.to/tether-critical-announcement/).
