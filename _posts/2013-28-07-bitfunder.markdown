This was a clear application vulnerability with a potentially [fraudulent cover up and incident response](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2018/02/23/bitcoin-exchange-founder-charged-with-covering-up-hack/). On July 28, 2013, hackers discovered an application condition that allowed them to credit accounts from a wallet supporting multiple organizations (Bitfunder and WeExchange). While the [SEC found fraud](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-23), this seems to be more related to handling of the breach and operating an unregistered exchange.

> During the summer of 2013, one or more individuals (the “Hackers”) exploited a weakness in the BitFunder programming code to cause BitFunder to credit the Hackers with profits they did not, in fact, earn (the “Exploit”).  As a result, the Hackers were able to wrongfully withdraw from WeExchange approximately 6,000 bitcoins, with the majority of those coins being wrongfully withdrawn between July 28, 2013, and July 31, 2013.  In today’s value, the wrongfully withdrawn bitcoin were worth more than $60 million.  As a result of the Exploit, BitFunder and WeExchange lacked the bitcoins necessary to cover what MONTROLL owed to users.
