On December 21 2020, some large withdrawals from EXMO hot wallets were detected. EXMO has advised to not deposit into the exchange until further notice. They have ensured their cold storage is safe and only unauthorised access were to their hot wallets

> We are still investigating the incident, but as of now, the security audit report showed that some amounts of BTC, XRP, ZEC, USDT, ETC and ETH in EXMO’s hot wallets were transferred out of the exchange. We reacted immediately and re-deployed hot wallets. The affected hot wallets comprise near 5% of the total assets. Let us stress that all the assets in the cold wallets are safe.

> In the meantime, we ask you NOT TO DEPOSIT ANY FUNDS TO THE EXISTING EXMO WALLETS. All the withdrawals are suspended at the moment.
