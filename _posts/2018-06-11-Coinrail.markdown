Coinrail is a South Korean cryptocurrency exchange. It is reported to have [lost $40 million](2) in cryptocurrency in a post on [their website](1).

> On June 10, there was a system check due to the hacking attempt at dawn. At present, we have confirmed that 70% of the coin rail total coin / token reserves are safely stored
I moved to a cold wallet and it's being saved. About 80% of coins that have been confirmed to be leaked have been frozen / withdrawn / redeemed or equivalent, in consultation with their co-workers and related exchanges, while the remainder are under investigation with investigators, related exchanges and coin developers.

Interestingly, South Korean Law Enforcement worked pretty quickly to [help contain the issue](https://medium.com/pundix/pundi-x-assists-coinrail-to-investigate-the-breach-incident-960c6a0e2c76) with maintainers of the coins that had theft.
