> On November 6 (GMT), hackers used the dydx flashloan to launch an attack on Cheese Bank, resulting in a loss of more than $3.3 million.The hacker transferred 1 ETH on the anonymous platform for the initial handling fee. By calling dydx’s flashloan contract, the hacker borrowed 21000 ETH, and used 50 ETH to purchase 107232 Cheese in Uniswap. 107232 Cheese and 78.8 ETH were added into the Uniswap liquidity pool to obtain Cheese-ETH UNI LP tokens, and all of them were deposited into Cheese Bank. After this operation, hackers continued to use 20000 ETH to attack the Cheese token price in Uniswap, resulting in the instantaneous increase of the value of Cheese-ETH UNI LP tokens by 300 times, and the stable currencies such as USDT/ USDC / Dai of Cheese Bank are all borrowed up. 58812 USDC in the stolen funds were converted into 132 ETH to pay the fees during the attack. After that, all the stolen assets were converted to BTC through multiple DeFi platforms, renBTC and other institutions. The subsequent complex and intensive transfer operations are continued.
