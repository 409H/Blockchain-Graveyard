342,000 ETH was stolen from Upbit hot wallet on November 27, 2019. A full post mortem has not been released yet, though it looks like the unauthorized transaction was signed from a different process as; hot <-> cold wallet reassignment and user withdrawals due to onchain variables: input data, gas limit, gas price.

Popular service (whale_alert) [tweeted the transaction](https://twitter.com/whale_alert/status/1199540095126257664) on November 27, 2019 very shortly after the transaction was confirmed on the Ethereum (ETH) Network.

Upbit took an impressive 50 minutes to be notified and roll out a plan to secure their remaining funds and issue an announcement.
