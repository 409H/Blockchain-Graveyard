$25 Million with smart contract exploit. Strangely, returned.

> We know that the hackers utilized a vulnerability with the combination of using ERC777 tokens and DeFi smart contracts to execute a reentrancy attack. The callback mechanism enabled the hacker to supply and withdraw ERC777 tokens repeatedly before the balance was updated. More analysis on the hack can be viewed from PeckShieldâ€™s report.
