<div class="home">
  These cryptocurrency institutions have suffered intrusions resulting in stolen financials, or shutdown of the product. Nearly all closed down afterward. These could have been prevented:

<ul class="intro-ul">
  <li>Lack of cold storage</li>
  <li>Social Engineering / Credential Re-Use</li>
  <li>Simple intrusions on Cloud Hosted Infrastructure</li>
  <li>Application vulnerability allowing malicious transactions</li>
</ul>

Below you'll find as close to a root cause as it publicly available, with a link to more information in the breach.

  <ul class="post-list">
    {% for post in site.posts %}
      <li>
        <h2>
          <a class="post-link" href="{{ post.link }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
        </h2>
        <blockquote>
          {{post.content}}
        </blockquote>
        <div>

    {% endfor %}
