# Blockchain-Graveyard
Publicly known blockchain incidents that include details of the breach or victim statements.

## Contributing
This site consists of two main sections: The _Graveyard_ is an enumeration of large incidents that we can see in one place. The _Avoiding The Graveyard_ section is for beginners advice to the enormous security subject matter required to lock down a blockchain company.

### Graveyard
All content you'd want to add will live in `_posts` and should follow similar markup. Only `title:` and `link:` are really important.

Links are preferred in this order of quality:

1. Announcements or Post-Mortems from the primary victim (Email, blog posts, website announcements, tweets)
2. Interviews of primary victims with commentary about the breach with journalists
3. Primary victims discussing breach in public forums or communities
4. Good journalism

Link bait, opinion pieces, or victimized customer rants not accepted.

### Avoiding The Graveyard
The advice section will be pretty heavily moderated. It's designed to be extremely introductory to avoid overwhelming information, and fairly broad.
