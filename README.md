All content you'd want to add will live in `_posts`. Must follow similar markup.

Additions are preferred in this order of quality:

1. Announcements or Post-Mortems from the primary victim (Email, blog posts, website announcements, tweets)
2. Interviews of primary source victims with commentary about the breach with journalists
3. Primary victims discussing breach in public forums or communities
4. Good journalism with technical data or observations

Do not submit link bait, opinion pieces, or customer rants not accepted. This is meant to be a technical resource for security teams.

Please add any raw details about the breach into the body of the post, directly quoted from the underlying link if possible
